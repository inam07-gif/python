# Spam Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based spam message classification system.  
The goal is to automatically identify whether a given text message is **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning.

The model is trained on labeled text data and can also predict spam for **new user-input messages**.

---

## What This Project Does
- Takes a text message as input
- Processes and cleans the text
- Converts text into numerical features
- Classifies the message as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- Provides the **probability of spam**, not just a label

---

## How It Works

### 1. Text Preprocessing
Each message is cleaned to reduce noise and standardize input:
- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove punctuation and special characters
- Tokenize text into words
- Remove stopwords
- Apply stemming

This helps the model focus on meaningful words.

---

### 2. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)
The cleaned text is transformed into numerical form using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**.

TF-IDF:
- Assigns importance to words based on their frequency
- Reduces the impact of common words
- Produces sparse feature vectors suitable for text classification

---

### 3. Model Training
Machine learning model:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

**Multinomial Naive Bayes** was selected as the final model because:
- It performs well on sparse text data
- It is fast and memory-efficient
- It achieved high precision in spam detection

---

### 4. Prediction and Decision Threshold
Instead of relying only on class labels, the model uses **probability-based predictions**.

- The model outputs probabilities for both classes (spam and ham)
- A decision threshold is applied to determine the final prediction
- This allows better control over false positives and false negatives

---

### 5. User Input Support
The trained model allows users to:
- Enter a custom message
- Receive a spam/ham prediction
- See the associated spam probability

This makes the system suitable for real-world usage.

---

## Libraries Used
- **Python** – core programming language
- **scikit-learn** – model training, evaluation, TF-IDF
- **NLTK** – text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords, stemming)
- **pandas** – data handling
- **NumPy** – numerical operations

---


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that classical machine learning techniques, when combined with proper text preprocessing and feature extraction, can effectively solve spam detection problems. Multinomial Naive Bayes proved to be a reliable and efficient choice for this task.
